# SOLID
That stands for five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design. 

### `S`ingle responsibility principle
Every class should have only one reason to change.
### `O`pen/closed principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. 
### `L`iskov substitution principle
Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
If class A is a subtype of class B, then object of type B maby replaced with object of type A
### `I`nterface segregation principle
 States that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
### `D`ependency inversion principle
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
